- fedes1to (ZygiskPG creator)
- xz3phyr (developed many features)
- 55ar. (some funky features)
- unknownuser7 (anticheat bypass dev and aimbot/esp)
- chr1s (ZygiskPG creator)

It is a sucessor to [ZygiskPG](https://github.com/fedes1to/ZygiskPG), and it uses Xposed to inject itself, bypassing the old Pixel Gun 3D anticheat (see UnitySendMessage hook)

Enjoy!
