## This menu was made by [modfs], which are made up by:

- fedes1to (ZygiskPG creator)
- xz3phyr (developed many features)
- 55ar. (some funky features)
- unknownuser7 (anticheat bypass dev)
- Hussain (Tester)
- Pulsed (idk)
- chr1s (ZygiskPG creator)
- VerifedMatt (human offset updater)
- BoredKarma (made websocket)
- Acessor (anticheat bypass dev)


It is a sucessor to [ZygiskPG](https://github.com/fedes1to/ZygiskPG), and it uses Xposed to inject itself, bypassing the old Pixel Gun 3D anticheat (see UnitySendMessage hook)

Enjoy!
